# **ICS 2370 Compiler Construction**


## Part 1
 - Write a LEX specification files to: 
  >i). Count the number of words in a file and their total size

  **solution**
  
  *file solution1.l*
>ii). Accepts the English language words (without bothering for the meaning) and replaces 
each occurrence of the string “abc” in it to “ABC”. 

**solution**

*file solution2.l*

## Part 2
- The following is a listing of a set of verbs:
>is am are were
was be being been
do does did will
would should can could
has have had go

*Write a simple LEX specification to recognize these verb*

**solution**

*solution3.l*

## Part 3

- Using the Recursive Descent strategy, write a C program for a simple calculator that 
can be used to perform integer arithmetic involving ‘+’ and ‘*’. Let your program 
consist of a set of mutually recursive routines.

**solution**

*solution4.l*
## Part 4
- Using the following grammar
> S -> a S | b

Create an interpreter using LEX and YACC which will count the number of a’s in the 
input string.

**solution**

*solution5.l*
## Part 5

- Write a LEX and YACC specification files for a small calculator that can add and 
subtract numbers.

**solution**

*solution6.l*

 contains **CFG**

 *solution6b.l*
